## Get Started

This repo contains a client and a server, both written in TypeScript:

- **client**: React app setup with [squid-js](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/squid-js), bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- **server**: Node.js app, utilizing [Express](https://expressjs.com). The server provides various microservices, like remote file checking. The endpoints are documented in [server Readme](server/).

To spin up both, the client and the server in a watch mode for local development, execute:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the client in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits to files in either `./client` or `./server`.
